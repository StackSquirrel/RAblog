## Sir Sanford Fleming college
Every year for the past few years, I have done a guest lecture for the **Preservation of Books, Photos and Archival Materials** course (SCIE0047) in Fleming College’s **Cultural Heritage Conservation and Management** program, (session instructor Laura Cunningham).
The last time I taught it was on June 16, 2017.

# Print publications

For a while, I was writing reviews of books and websites for various library publicaitons. While I have not done so for a while, I may return to the practice, which I find very useful for professional developement. Here are some of the ones I have published.
