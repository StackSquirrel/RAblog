## About the story

An emotional but difficult read, this is the story of a Métis family in Winnipeg's North end, near an undeveloped section called the Break. 

**Warning**: There is extreme and graphic violence of a sexual nature against a young girl.

Set in the modern era, it follows mainly the women in an extended family: grandmother, aunties, mothers, daughters, cousins. Their strong relationships help them weather the difficult life caused by racism and poverty, and cope with the absolute horror of what happened to one of their youngsters.

The family does not live in isolation: the author eloquently expresses their place in the community and in the city in which they live. The story also follows the family and the relations of the perpetrator of the violent crime.

This book has won multiple awards, and for just cause, as it is a superb piece of writing. It is not, however, either easy to read or forgettable. It is her first novel, following her first book, **North End Love Songs** (2013), a poetry collection.

It is on the Canada Reads list for 2018, CBC's annual "Battle of the books", which takes place March 26-29, 2018.
