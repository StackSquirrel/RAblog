## About the story

I love the way Cory Doctorow explores the present through the lens of potential futures and alternate realities. He holds strong opinions on many issues, and puts his money where his mouth is: you have to respect someone like that.

This is his second collection of stories, published long ago in 2007.

These stories are not always easy to read, as his themes can and do get quite heavy and dark at times. But his work is characterised, I would say, by inventiveness and a solid, logical construction that make them seem both realistic and inevitable. Or, at least, evitable if we get off our collective butts and help out now. I personally find his approach to social-justice and technology to be very compelling.

This collection of short stories sort of exemplifies what I mean.

Each one is preceded by an introduction by the author, and each story is read by a different narrator. This lends a real dynamic range to the audiobook, and helps you transition from one story to another if you read them consecutively. Myself, I have to stop at the end of each story (or book) that I read and walk with it for a while, to transition between them. When reading short stories or novellas, I often switch to another of the several concurrent books that I am reading. That's one reason I don't review more of them!

This books contains the following stories, many of which have won prestigious awards which I will not mention here:

* *Printcrime* (2006) is set in a city where countries who are determined to collect their copyright royalties are at war with those whose economy is based on royalty-free 3D printing.
* *When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth* (2006) is an apocalyptic story set in Toronto. It is terrible and sad and hopeful.
* *Anda's Game* (2005), a takeoff on Ender's Game by Oroson Scott Card, follows a young gamer into a world where skill and exploitation of oppressed labourers become all too real. Not only does it portray strong young female protagonists, it shows how personal decisions can add up to something important.
* *I, Robot* (2005) is a philosophical and religious examination of one robot's internal life after the Singularity.
* *I, Rowboat* (2006) is also a philosophical and religious examination of one robot's internal life after the Singularity. This time, that robot is a rowboat. I love this story.
* *After the Siege* (2007?) follows a young girl as her city becomes embroiled in a war. She does what she must. It's a hard read, but a good one.
