## About the story

This is a forthcoming book, which I read as a galley proof. I used the Adobe Digital Editions reader to read this DRM e-book, with [NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)](https://www.nvaccess.org/) a by-donation screen reader that allows blind and visually-impaired people use computers and the internet.

The awkward thing about reading this type of book is the fact that the DRM layer makes the text difficult to understand.

Also, it reads EVERY header and footer (the page-layout footer is still attached, so it's a good 15-20 seconds at the end of each and every page -- you have to remember the part of the sentence you just heard in order to understand the next bit! Surprisingly difficult.).

I found this book to be a compelling read about humans, Neanderthals, archaeology, motherhood, and survival.

Award-winning author Claire Cameron blends modern scientific research, compassion and wisdom to tell a story of evolution, community and struggle that spans thousands of years.

Rose, a modern-day archaeologist discovers irrefutable proof that modern humans co-habitated with Neanderthals. In the distant past, a Neanderthal named Girl lives with family and faces the daily challenges with those she loves. Meanwhile, Rose does the same.

This is a book that challenges modern assumptions about Neanderthals, motherhood and the place of community in our lives. There is some sex, and some readers may be upset by graphic descriptions of violence toward animals. The story is engaging and hard to put down.
