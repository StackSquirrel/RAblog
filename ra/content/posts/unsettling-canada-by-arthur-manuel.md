## About the story

Arthur Manuel has been on the front lines of the battle for the recognition of indigenous rights, and specifically aboriginal title to the land, all his life.

Part memoir, part history, this books is very interesting reading. Written from a First Nations perspective and taking into account the positions of indigenous peoples worldwide, Manuel traces the long history of struggle.

His father, George Manuel, was President of the National Indian Brotherhood and founded the World Council of Indigenous Peoples. Arthur, a leader in the Secwepemc (Shushwap) community, played an important role on both the national and international fight to win economic recognition for aboriginal title and rights.

The narrator, Ken Luginbuhl, does a good job with what I imagine are very challenging spellings and pronunciations, reading naturally and fluently.

### Recommended?

I certainly learned a lot, and think you probably would, too. No matter how familiar you are with the topic, the details and the personal narrative thread Manuel uses makes it less like a history lesson and more like a long conversation. Think Massey Lecture, only — well — longer, with no audience.
