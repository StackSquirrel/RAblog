## About the story

Set in the 16th century England of Elizabeth I, this historical novel tells the story of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542-1587). It is narrated from the perspectives of three people: in Mary's own voice, in that of George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, and in that of Bess of Hardwick, his wife. The recorded book is read by two people: Anne Glatt reads Mary and Bess, while Mark Rosen reads George.

Mary is already Queen Elizabeth's captive at the start of the story. She is sent in exile to live with George and Bess under house arrest, and spends her time plotting escape and the overthrow of her rival. George, ever mindful of the honour of the Talbots, falls in love with her and is torn by his divided loyalties to the two queens. Bess, who primarily cares for her own hard-won riches, is pulled away from the tranquil management of her estates and ruined by the devastating costs of the exiled queen's court.

The story provides many details about the life the nobility of the period, rife with political intrigue and the threat of war. It moves at a moderate to slow pace. 

### Recommended?

If you enjoy the post-Reformation politics of the Elizabethan era, you will enjoy this book, which goes into great detail about the people and life at the time. I confess that it did not hold my undivided attention.
