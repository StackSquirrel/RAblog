## About the story

This is the first in an excellent series of books that follow the adventures of Nina (aged 13) and Kit, short for Christopher, who is a year younger. I read them first in the early 2000s, and found them delightful.

Set in New York, Nina finds a library book that becomes her guide into a new reality, where magic exists and is based on very complicated seies of calculations. She accepts increasingly difficult challenges and very serious responsibilities, she learns a lot and makes good friends of truly staggering diversity.

I have read several of these books, it's a series I really love. They have only just been published on the CELA site and I heartily recommend them for people aged 12 and up who enjoy a good story and a very different way of looking at the world. If you know a teen or a sci-fi/fantasy lover, they will enjoy this all-ages series.

They all last in the 7-hour range, and the narrator (Christina Moore) is excellent.
