It occurs to me that, since I began my sabbatical in March, I have not been posting about my recreational reading. I am still reading for fun, but much less than I did when in the normal run of things. The difference is shocking!

While off, I have been indulging in my desire to learn Python programming for data munging, and also Web stuff like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, and various volunteer web-development projects. Stuff like that with which I will not bore you now.

However, one very exciting project -- with which I do plan to bore you -- is that, since February, I have been training a service dog to help me cope with my vision-loss. Now, in Canada, it is well-nigh impossible to find out anything about doing that, about how to do it or even about what the requirements are for a trained dog. I'm not really sure why it's such a state secret, other than that agencies who do train service dogs guard their territory jealously (and will not even return phone calls!). But, for whatever reason, it's been quite a long struggle.

The closest I could come was to watch several Service Dog Certification tests in the US on YouTube and to backwards engineer how to teach a dog to do that stuff. (Only BC and Alberta have certification tests in Canada.) I also took a Guide Dog course through the wonderful **[Hadley Institute for the Blind and Visually Impaired](https://www.hadley.edu/Default.asp)**, an online distance-education organisation through which I am learning Braille, and how to use raised dots to make my life easier, etc. Important coping skills.

In July, though, the owner of my local dog-training school put me on to Donna Hill's **[Service Dog Training Institute](http://servicedogtraininginstitute.ca) (SDTI)**, an online school to help Canadians train their own service dogs.  What a wonderful thing! She is working to the BC standard for certification. Thank you, Donna!

My dog Laddie will turn 8 months old this week. He is a Standard Poodle, due to allergies in the household, and he is as sweet as the day is long. He is also quite energetic and easily aroused, so we spend a lot of time on calming behaviour, in addition to general obedience training.

Like all "kids these days", he has his own Instagram feed, **[@Laddiethedog](https://www.instagram.com/laddiethedog/)**. Check it out if you want to see desperately cute pictures of a (mostly sleeping) poodle puppy. The ones where he is not asleep he is generally just a blur, in case you are wondering about my esthetic choices.

We started Puppy School at the **[Toronto Centre for Canine Education](https://www.thetcce.com/)** when he was young to socialise him, but continued on to the Secondary School level because we liked the classes and the support was very, very welcome! Apart from that, I was making it up based on previous dog-training experience and on my years of training horses when I was young.

It's a lot of work, and I have not been reading like I used to do. I will try to post about the books I have been reading (too many of them now are about dogs and dog-training), though, once I get back into blogging.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure no one actually reads this blog, but it makes me feel a bit less alone in this to have a one-sided conversation with myself in a blog...
