## About the story

This anthology, compiled by Will Ferguson and originally published in 2006, is a veritable Who’s Who of Canadian humour. You find all the expected names: Stewart McLean, Douglas Copeland, Robertson Davies and, of course, Steven Leacock.

However, with over 70 different authors represented, you will surely find new voices that you want to read. From a reader’s advisory perspective, this is pure gold. I do wish it were easier to take notes while reading an audiobook on the go, while blind. I remember a truly hilarious sequence by Sandra Shamas, author of **Wit's End**. I do believe I need to read this book. How I laughed!

There are modern writers, writers from the '30s, writers from French Canada. This is a very valuable collection and I’m very glad to read it.

The two narrators, Barbara Lord and Chris Caughey, took turns depending on the gender of the author whose work they were reading. This was useful, since several excerpts from each author were read. After a while, it does get confusing as an audiobook, but it was so much fun to read.

I did read it over the course of several weeks, because I generally crave longer narrative fiction. But I did read several of these pieces between each longer book, and when I just wanted a quick pick me up.

Highly recommended, so long as you are not in a hurry. Some descriptions of sex, violence and strong language.

A good overview. Fun to read (but not all at once!).
