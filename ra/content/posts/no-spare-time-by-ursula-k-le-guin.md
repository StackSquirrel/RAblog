## About the story

I read this book in pre-publication, in PDF format, using [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org).

This book is the "the best of" [Ursula K. Le Guin’s blog](http://www.ursulakleguin.com/Blog2017.html#New), which I have been loving for years. It is divided into a number of different themes or blocks of essays: 

* "Going Over Eighty" (life as an older person), 
* "The Lit Biz" (life as an author), 
* "Trying to Make Sense of It" (showcasing her astute social observations), and 
* "The Rewards" (about things she enjoys). 

Each block of essays is bookended by "The Annals of Pard" (short stories about a kitten and, later, a cat she adopted, whose personality she imbues with fiction-esque motivations and drama). 

Throughout, she is funny, wise and trenchant, coming at each topic with her own inimitable point of view.

### Recommended?

It’s masterful and delightful writing: a great read that will also make you think.

Like all her work, highly recommended.
