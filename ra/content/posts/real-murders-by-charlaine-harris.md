## About the story

This is the first novel in a series of murder-mysteries featuring Aurora Teagarden, a library worker who -- in this one at least -- belongs to a sort of book club slash fan club on real murders (as in, analysing how famous murders of the past were done and theorising whodunnit).

It's not too graphic and definitely not a police procedural novel. It has engaging characters, and a charming protagonist with an interesting situation and set of supporting characters. It's set in the South of the United States.

This novel was published in 2009 and is followed by "A bone to pick".

### Recommended?

It's overall pretty readable, and I quite enjoyed Thérèse Plummer's reading of it. I may check out the sequels for some light reading.
