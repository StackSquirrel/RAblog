## About the story

The first thing I want to say about this book is that it was way, way too short. I really enjoyed it.

Set in 1948, young Gellis (Jilly) Ramsey inherits a lovely 18th-century cottage from her aunt, also named Gellis. The book also tells the (somewhat sad) story of her younger life, and the important role her aunt played it it. It goes on to tell the story of meeting her neighbours and finding her place in the England of WWII. You meet neighbours, pets and the memory of her aunt.

One of the big questions that hovers around this book is "was her aunt a witch"? It remains delightfully unanswered, but it looks at the traditions characteristics and behaviours that would lead one to be classified as a witch half a century ago.

Pauline Munro, the narrator, is wonderful to listen to: her slight English accent suited the text, and she reads with great understanding and vivacity.

My only complaint really, as I said earlier: it was just over too quickly!

### Recommended?

I very much enjoyed this book, which is a quick read.
