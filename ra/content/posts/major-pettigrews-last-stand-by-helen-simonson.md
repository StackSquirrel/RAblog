## About the story

Author Helen Simonson's debut novel, *Major Pettigrew's Last Stand* is a delightful read.

The main character, Major Ernest Pettigrew (retired), lives alone in the small Sussex village of Edgecombe St. Mary some years after the death of his wife. A witty old bachelor attached to the quiet society of the village in which he lives, he loves shooting, civility and a well-brewed cup of tea.

As he finds himself drifting into a closer and closer friendship with a fellow villager, the widowed Mrs. Jasmina Ali who runs the village shop, he brushes up against the censure of his neighbours for his "inappropriate liaison".

Mrs. Ali who, despite having lived there for years is essentially an outsider in this close-knit community, meets with the disapproval of her family, for whom she cares deeply.

Both characters learn about themselves, each other and the people around them. Both take a courageous stand.

I won't tell you what happens, just that it's an engaging novel,  unexpected suspenseful and often touching. It takes on stereotypes of age and race. It insists that responsibilities be assumed and choices made.

I enjoyed the reading of Stephen Thorne, who narrated it. His voice suits the story and he has a feel for the art of storytelling.

I look forward to Helen Simonson's next novel, **The summer before the war**, also set in Sussex, England. It's available now in print, but has not yet been put into an accessible format. While it is [available on Bookshare](https://www.bookshare.org/browse/book/1206356?returnPath=L3NlYXJjaD9tb2R1bGVOYW1lPXB1YmxpYyZrZXl3b3JkPXNpbW9uc29uLCBoZWxlbg%3D%3D), it's not yet available to Canadians.
